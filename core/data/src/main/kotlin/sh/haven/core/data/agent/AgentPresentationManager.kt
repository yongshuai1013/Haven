/**
 * The agent → user "here, look at / listen to this" channel.
 *
 * Unlike [AgentUiCommandBus] (fire-and-forget navigation *commands* with
 * `replay = 0`), a presented image or sound is **state**: it must stay on
 * screen until the user dismisses it, and survive a recomposition or a
 * brief backgrounding. So this mirrors [AgentConsentManager]'s shape — a
 * `@Singleton` holding a [StateFlow] queue the top-of-tree host renders.
 *
 * It is deliberately *not* a consent gate. Showing an image is not a
 * destructive act, so [present] never suspends and never asks: the agent
 * calls it and returns immediately; the overlay is itself the user-facing
 * artifact, and is freely dismissible. The user keeps the wheel by
 * dismissing, not by pre-approving.
 *
 * ### Backing files
 *
 * Each entry owns a cache file written by the caller. [dismiss] deletes
 * it. To bound disk use against a chatty agent the queue is capped at
 * [MAX_QUEUE]; pushing past the cap drops (and deletes the file of) the
 * oldest entry.
